# sequence-packing

To run this code you will first need to replace the modelling_gpt2.py file in your version of the transformers library with the version in this github. From there, refer to simple_sequence_packv3.py and the arguments in the program "SEQUENCE_PACK", "THREED_MASK", "batch_size", "SEQ_LENGTH" to experiment with sequence packing, using the 3d mask, etc.
